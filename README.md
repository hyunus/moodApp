# mood
Welcome to mood: an interactive diary for anyone to use!

The purpose of mood is simple - allow users to record their thoughts and feelings, as well as have a visual record of their feelings.

mood has endless potential - track mood trends, suggest articles/videos/books based on how the user is feeling, and even connect users to each other.

mood was inspired partly by the mood rings everyone had in 5th grade, and partly by my own midterm stress. When you feel down, the first step is to understand why - and writing about it can help with that. 

mood aims to help users understand that emotions are not binary through the use of color - confidence is an aggressive happiness, whereas nostalgia is a sad happiness. With this in mind, users will be able to own their emotions, and feel in control! 

mood is easy to start with - just enter in a username and password, and click 'sign up'.
